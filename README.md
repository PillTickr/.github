# PillTickr

**Your friendly, open-source medicine checklist & reminder app.**

PillTickr helps users stay on top of their medication schedule with:
- **Smart reminders** that adapt to your habits and avoid dangerous overlaps  
- **Visual checklists** for quick, at-a-glance dose tracking  
- **Context-aware prompts** (“Take this 30 min after breakfast”, “Refill due in 3 days”)  
- **Offline-first & encrypted sync**—use it without internet, then securely back up to the cloud  
- **Caregiver support**—share schedules with family or healthcare providers  
- **Accessibility-focused design** with large text, color-blind-safe palettes, voice cues, and dark mode  

Built with React Native + Expo, SQLite (offline) and Firebase/Supabase (optional sync).
